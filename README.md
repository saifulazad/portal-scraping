## Introduction 
Scraping is a hot topic nowadays. This is a demo about my scraping skill. [bdjobs](http://jobs.bdjobs.com/jobsearch.asp?fcatId=8) is the largest job posting site in Bangladesh. We are only concern on IT-related jobs.
Please note that this is only for training and educational purpose. Do not use this to hamper our bdjobs portal.  

## How does it work:
Basically, there are two folders. one is `extractor` and another is `scraper`.
